# almond

*almond* is a [Scala](https://scala-lang.org) kernel for [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).

It mostly wraps the [Ammonite](http://ammonite.io) Scala shell in a Jupyter kernel,
with the addition of custom Jupyter-specific APIs. It is formerly known as
*jupyter-scala*.

It also provides libraries allowing one to write custom Jupyter kernels
in Scala.

*This is the documentation for version @VERSION@*.
