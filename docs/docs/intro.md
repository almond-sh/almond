# almond

*almond* is a [Scala](https://scala-lang.org) kernel for [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org). It is formerly known as *jupyter-scala*.

It features:
- all the [Ammonite](http://ammonite.io) niceties,
- an [API](api.md) that libraries can rely on to interact with Jupyter front-ends,
- extensible [plotting](usage-plotting.md) support,
- extensible support for big data libraries, with in particular
- [Spark support](usage-spark.md), relying on [ammonite-spark](https://github.com/alexarchambault/ammonite-spark), extended to get progress bars among others.

It also provides libraries allowing one to [write custom Jupyter kernels
in Scala](dev-custom-kernel.md).

*This is the documentation for version @VERSION@*.
